    <p>If you are like me, cake boxes are very convienient, but they often have very high sugar content. This recipe uses a lower amount of sugar than a typical pre-made box, without sacrificing flavor. A portion of the sugar and brown sugar are subsituted with a greater concentration and combination of cinnamon, milk, butter, and vanilla.</p>

    <h3>Some benefits to this recipe include:</h3>
    <p> <ul> 
        <li>Reduced sugar leads to better digestion</li>
        <li>You'll naturally gain more skills in baking</li>
        <li>Ability to customize elements as you see fit</li>
    </ul> 
    Now that you have an idea and (hopefully) some more motivation to bake, let's continue to how the cinnamon rolls are actually made!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li>4-5 cups (520g-650g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
        <li>¼> cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons (1 package) instant yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup (180mL) water</li>
        <li>>½ cup (120mL) milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup (60g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li>>6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, very soft</li>
        <li>¾ cup (150g) packed brown sugar, light or dark</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h4>Icing</h4>
    <p><ul>
        <li>4 oz (115g) full fat block cream cheese, room temperature</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups (195g) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p><ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 3 cups of flour (to start), sugar, yeast, and salt. Whisk to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium microwave safe bowl or cup, combine water, milk, and sliced butter. Microwave in 10 second bursts until the butter just melts and the mixture feels warm but not hot. You can also do this with a pot placed on a stove burner set to low heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg into the water mixture to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients over the flour mixture. Using a wooden spoon, mix together until you have a very thick and sticky dough.</li>
        <li>Add another 1 cup of flour to the dough and mix until it starts coming together into ball. </li>
        <li>This next step can be done directly in your bowl or on a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough, adding flour as needed to keep it from sticking to your hands / the sides of the bowl, until it's smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky. If you poke the top of the dough, it should spring back - if the indent remains, the dough needs more kneading.</li>
        <h4>Here is a useful video on how to knead your dough:</h4>

        <li>Cover the dough and set aside for about 20 minutes. The dough will puff up slightly but won't double in size. This is just to relax the gluten and make the dough easier to roll without it pulling in on itself.</li>
        <li>Turn the rested dough onto a lightly floured work surface and roll it out into a roughly 14x10 inch rectangle. Use your hands to press and pull the edges to get as nice of a rectangular shape as you can - it doesn't have to be perfect though!</li>
        <li>Spread the softened butter over the dough, leaving a roughly ½ inch boarder along the edges. Sprinkle the sugar on top and use your hands to spread it out into an even layer over the butter. Finally, sprinkle the cinnamon evenly on top.</li>
        <li>Working from the longer side of the dough, roll it up into a log.</li>
        <li>Cut about ½ an inch off each end of the log (this just makes for nicer and more uniform rolls - you can bake them off separately or just skip this step if you don't mind the appearance).</li>
        <li>Use a sharp serrated knife to cut the log into 12 even rolls. If using a knife, cut the rolls using a sawing motion to prevent squishing.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rolls cut side up in a 9x13 inch baking dish. There should be a tiny bit of space between each roll but it's fine if they're touching. </li>
        <li>Cover the rolls and set aside in a warm place for about 45 minutes or until about doubled in size. My favorite place to keep cinnamon rolls during this time is in the oven (it shouldn't be on or hot) just because it keeps the rolls safe from any cold drafts. They'll be pressed up against each other once they puff up - that's normal!</li>
        <li>Take the rolls out of the oven and preheat the oven to 350F.</li>
        <li>Uncover the rolls and place into the center of your preheated oven. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a nice golden brown on top. Set aside while you make the icing. </li>
        <li>In a medium sized bowl, combine icing ingredients. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a wooden spoon by hand, cream together until smooth.</li>
        <li>While the cinnamon rolls are still warm, spread the icing on top. It'll melt slightly and make them extra gooey! </li>
    </ol></p>
