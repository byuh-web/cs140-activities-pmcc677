        <h3>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS</h3>
        <p>Inline only affects the local/specific line you wish to adjust. Inline takes priority. Emebdded affects the same tag, and is declared in the head section. External is a seperate document with rules to define a template.</p>
        <h3>Why is external preferred?</h3>
        <p>One should only use CSS because you can create a 'defualt' layout that can be used across all programs.</p>
